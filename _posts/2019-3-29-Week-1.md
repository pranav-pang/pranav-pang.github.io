Currently, a major area of investigation in the field of autonomous vehicle design is obstacle avoidance, enabling an autonomous vehicle, 
such as a car to respond to a dynamically changing environment. An autonomous vehicle relies on path planning and control algorithms in 
order to make a decision on which way to move based on sensor and visual data, but this can get complicated when other objects, especially 
moving objects interfere with a vehicleâ€™s environment. The goal of our project is to enable an F 1/10 autonomous race car to avoid 
obstacles, making use of the various sensors the car has onboard, while building our own functionality on top of the existing system.

Our baseline goals for this project are enabling static and dynamic autonomous obstacle avoidance, that is avoiding stationary and 
moving objects. Our reach goal for the project is to autonomously overtake another car, similar to how a car might pass another while 
traveling on a highway.
