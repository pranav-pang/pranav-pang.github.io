title: Week 1

This week, we kicked off our project by familiarizing ourselves with the F 1/10 platform, including learning to control the car manually and SSHing into the car. We also needed to learn to use the various ROS topics and modules used to control the car. Much of the car's more high level code, such as wall following, particle filter localization, etc, is comprised of Python scripts, and we will likely be using Python for our code as well. We also managed to get some preliminary test scans with the Lidar sensor. A scan of the room we were working in is shown below, using RViz to display the data.
