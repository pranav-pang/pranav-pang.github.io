title: Project Idea and Pitch
---

Currently, a major area of investigation in the field of autonomous vehicle design is obstacle avoidance, enabling an autonomous vehicle, such as a car to respond to a dynamically changing environment. An autonomous vehicle relies on path planning and control algorithms in order to make a decision on which way to move based on sensor and visual data, but this can get complicated when other objects, especially moving objects interfere with a vehicleâ€™s environment. The goal of our project is to enable an F 1/10 autonomous race car to avoid obstacles, making use of the various sensors the car has onboard, while building our own functionality on top of the existing system.
